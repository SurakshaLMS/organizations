# 🔗 Link-Only File Access System

## 📋 Current Setup
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage (GCS) - Private bucket
- **Access**: Files accessible ONLY via direct permanent links
- **Browsing**: Nobody can browse/see all files in the storage folder
- **URLs**: Permanent direct links - never expire until file is deleted

## 🚀 How It Works

### For Images (Cause Images)
1. Upload via `/cause/:causeId/image` endpoint
2. File stored in private GCS bucket (folder not browseable)
3. Returns permanent direct URL: `https://storage.googleapis.com/laas-file-storage/organization-images/[unique-filename]`
4. Anyone with the specific link can view the image
5. Nobody can see other images without knowing the exact link

### For Documents (Lecture Documents)
1. Upload via `/lecture/:lectureId/documents` endpoint
2. Files stored in private GCS bucket (folder not browseable)
3. Returns permanent direct URLs for each document
4. Anyone with the specific link can view the document
5. Nobody can browse or discover other documents

## 🔐 Security Features
- **No Folder Browsing**: Storage folders are private - cannot list contents
- **Link-Only Access**: Files accessible only via exact permanent URLs
- **Unique Filenames**: Each file gets a UUID-based unique name
- **Permanent Links**: URLs never expire (until file is deleted)
- **Direct Access**: No authentication needed once you have the link

## 📁 URL Format
- **Images**: `https://storage.googleapis.com/laas-file-storage/organization-images/[uuid].jpg`
- **Documents**: `https://storage.googleapis.com/laas-file-storage/[uuid].pdf`

## ✅ Benefits
- Simple implementation
- Fast direct access
- Permanent shareable URLs
- Privacy: Only accessible via specific links
- No complex security layers
- Files not discoverable by browsing

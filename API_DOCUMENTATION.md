# Organization Service API Documentation

## üìã Overview

This API provides **enhanced JWT-based organization access control** with optimized performance, security, and data minimization. All responses return only necessary data, exclude sensitive information, and support comprehensive pagination.

**üîê Enhanced Security Features:**
- **Organization-Based Access Control**: JWT tokens include user's organization IDs and roles
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Verify user has required permissions before executing methods  
- **Global Admin Support**: ORGANIZATION ADMIN has access to any organization
- **Real-time Access Updates**: Token refresh when organization memberships change

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000/organization/api/v1`

**Authentication:** JWT Bearer Token (required for protected endpoints)

## üöÄ Enhanced JWT Authentication System

### JWT Token Structure
The enhanced JWT tokens now include:

```json
{
  "sub": "user-id",
  "email": "user@example.com", 
  "name": "User Name",
  "organizationAccess": [
    {
      "organizationId": "org-123",
      "role": "PRESIDENT",
      "isVerified": true
    },
    {
      "organizationId": "org-456", 
      "role": "MEMBER",
      "isVerified": true
    }
  ],
  "isGlobalAdmin": false,
  "iat": 1752958468,
  "exp": 1753563268
}
```

### Access Control Rules
1. **Organization Membership**: User must be a verified member of the organization
2. **Role-Based Permissions**: Methods check for required roles (MEMBER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, PRESIDENT)
3. **Global Admin Override**: Users with `isGlobalAdmin: true` can access any organization
4. **Automatic Verification**: JWT includes only verified organization memberships

### Role Hierarchy
- **MEMBER**: Basic access (view members, leave organization)
- **MODERATOR**: Moderate content (MEMBER permissions + content management)
- **ADMIN**: Administrative tasks (MODERATOR permissions + user verification, institute assignment)
- **PRESIDENT**: Full control (ADMIN permissions + organization deletion)
- **GLOBAL_ADMIN**: Access to any organization (system-wide permissions)
